# Intro

This repository based from <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/> is just the same app but instead of a all-in-one file , I splitted out all files for more flexibility.

## Prerequisites

In order to have a fully up-and-running demo application, do not forget to enbale stackdriver api here:  <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudtrace.googleapis.com/>
Then you have to grant in you VM scope the role : "Cloud Trace Agent" !
